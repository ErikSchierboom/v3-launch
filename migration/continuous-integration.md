# Continuous integration

1. Add a workflow that uses the [configlet-ci GitHub Action](https://github.com/exercism/github-actions/tree/master/configlet-ci) to lint the track.

1. Convert any Exercism GitHub Actions workflows being used to use `main` as their branch instead of `master`. See [this issue](https://github.com/exercism/github-actions/issues/14).
